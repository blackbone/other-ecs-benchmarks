# What is all about?

General idea is to hide implementation of each ECS under context abstraction and work with it from benchmark
implementations.

Benchmarks design follow 2 rules which I try to balance with:

* **Strict usage** - to ensure all benchmarks are running with same flow to avoid cheating.
* **Features utilization** - to allow implementations to run in perfomant way.

General flow of any benchmark execution is divided into 3 steps:

* Preparation
    * Creating world
    * Creating initial entities if needed
    * Initialize filters and queries or other stuff which used to gain perfomance
* Benchmark call
    * Acquiring lock of world
    * Run main logic
    * Commiting changes
* Cleanup - mostly omitted

# Problems

1. Because of nature of BenchmarkDotNet there's sequential iteration of creating entities happening.
   This leads to case where, for example we're creating 100k entities in benchmark, it's properly cleared
   in Setup and Cleanup but benchmark itself will be called multiple times which will lead to creating 100k entities,
   then another 100k and in some cases lead to millions of entities in the world which can affect performance of creation
   and deletion on certain ECS implementations.
2. System benchmarks which uses *Padding* property produces up to 1.100.000 entities each because of logic of padding
   generation. It affects runs duration but for now i'm not sure about correct way do fix that (maybe keep entire
   entities count up to *EntityCount* so it'll not affect speed, but it'll reduce actual entity count to about 9.9k so archetype
   ecs implementation will gain significant boost).
3. Because some framework deleting entity on delete last components there are differences in behaviours in tests and
   benchmarks.
   For example **RemoveComponent** benchmark will work faster with Arch and Fennecs because they're not deleting entity.
   Because of that special property called `DeletesEntityOnLastComponentDeletion` is required to be implemented in each
   context.
